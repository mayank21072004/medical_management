## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive medical web application built using MongoDB, React.js, Node.js, and Express.js. It features JWT token-based authentication and authorization for secure access. The application includes two main panels: a user panel for patients to book appointments and manage their schedules, and an admin panel for overseeing the system and managing doctors. There is also potential for a future third panel dedicated to doctors. The app aims to facilitate seamless appointment bookings and home visits by medical professionals, providing a convenient and efficient healthcare solution.

## User Roles

There are three distinct user roles within the system:

#### Admin: 
- Doctor Management :->  Admins can add new doctors to the system,
- Appointment Management :-> Admins can review, accept, update, or mark appointments as pending, ensuring efficient scheduling and patient care.
- Message Management :-> Admins handle all incoming messages from patients, addressing their concerns, and facilitating communication between patients and doctors.
#### User: 
- Users can browse available doctors, select the one they wish to consult, and book appointments for home visits.
